==========

This is home of vim plugin http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1888

If you are editing diff file and you want to jump quickly to
corresponding source files, function DiffGoFile does that. Place
cursor on the spot in diff file which interests you, call |DiffGoFile|
and you will be presented with the source file exactly at the place
you were looking at. Currently only unified diff is supported, but the
script has framework for adding more types.
